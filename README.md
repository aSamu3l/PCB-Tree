# PCB-Tree: An ESP32-Powered Christmas Tree on PCB

This project began as an idea to create something festive and innovative for the holiday season. With a passion for learning and experimenting, I designed a miniature Christmas tree on a printed circuit board (PCB) and developed custom firmware using an ESP32 microcontroller to control LEDs in a variety of lighting patterns.

### ESP32 Firmware
The firmware for the PCB-Tree is designed to provide a selection of light effects that can be cycled manually with a button or will automatically change every 60 seconds. A dedicated button at the base allows for easy effect switching, giving the user control over the display.

The base also includes a power button to turn the ESP32 on and off, along with a convenient USB-C port for connecting the box to the ESP32. This setup simplifies power supply and programming access, allowing for straightforward integration and modification.

### Project Goals
This project is open-source, with the goal of encouraging collaboration and improvement. I invite anyone interested to contribute by enhancing the firmware, redesigning the PCB layout, or modifying the base structure to take the PCB-Tree to new levels.
