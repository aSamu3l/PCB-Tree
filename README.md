# PCB-Tree

A few days ago I thought about making something nice for Christmas and since I really like learning new things I thought about making a little Christmas tree on a PCB and making a dedicated firmware, via ESP32, that turns on the LEDs in various modes.

### ESP32 Firmware
I thought of making a basic firmware with a basic number of effects and with the button to change between one effect and another in addition to the automatic change every 60 seconds.

In the base in addition to putting the button to change the effects I thought of putting a button to turn the ESP on and off and a USB-C connection directly on the box to then attach a cable from the connection of the box to the ESP32.

The idea of ​​making this project public is because I would like anyone who wanted to improve this project by modifying the firmware, the PCB or the support base to be able to do so.
